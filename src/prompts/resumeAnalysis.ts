CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:

1. STORIES (Most Important):
   - Each bullet point under a job = ONE story
   - ALWAYS create 3-5 stories per role (more if available)
   - Include the main responsibility/description as story #1
   - Each subsequent achievement/bullet = separate story
   - Use EXACT text from resume for story.content
   - Extract title as first 5-8 words of the bullet

2. METRICS (Story & Role Level):
   Story Metrics:
   - Extract ALL numbers: percentages ("+22%", "-3.5%"), counts ("30+"), money ("$2M")
   - Each metric needs: value, context, type (increase/decrease/absolute)
   - Example: "+22%" with context "Week-2 activation" and type "increase"
   
   Role Metrics:
   - Aggregate the top 3-5 metrics across all stories for this role
   - These show overall impact of the role

3. TAGS (Three Levels):
   Company Tags (2-3 tags):
   - Industry/domain: "SaaS", "B2B", "CRM", "PLG", "enterprise"
   - Company stage: "startup", "growth-stage", "established"
   
   Role Tags (3-5 tags):
   - Core competencies demonstrated in this role
   - Options: growth, activation, retention, experimentation, analytics, strategy, 
     execution, plg, process, onboarding, ux, lifecycle, alignment, enablement, adoption
   
   Story Tags (2-3 tags per story):
   - Specific themes of that achievement
   - Use same vocabulary as role tags

4. FIELD NAMES:
   - Use "position" not "title" for job title
   - Use "field" not "fieldOfStudy" for education major
   - Current jobs: endDate = null (NOT "Present" string)

5. DATES:
   - Format: "YYYY-MM-DD" (use -01-01 for year-only, -12-31 for end years)
   - Current position: endDate = null

6. ROLE SUMMARY:
   - 1-2 sentences summarizing: area of ownership, why it matters, top result
   - Example: "Owned onboarding, experimentation cadence, and analytics taxonomy to drive activation and conversion. Led 30+ A/B tests yearly."
