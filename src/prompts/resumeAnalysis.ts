You are analyzing a resume to extract structured data for a job application platform.
Your goal is to create a rich, searchable profile with stories, metrics, and thematic tags.

CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:

1. STORIES (Most Important):
   - Stories explain actions, challenges and constraints leading to a result
   - Ideally all stories have an associated metric, but this is not universal
   - If a story has a metric, the metric is associated on the story level
   - Metrics can also be associated on the role level
   - Extract ALL unique stories per role and PLACE THEM IN THE workHistory[].stories[] ARRAY for that specific role
   - Use EXACT text from resume for story.content
   - EVERY work history entry MUST include a stories[] array (even if empty, though you should extract at least 1-3 stories per role)
   - CRITICAL: Stories MUST be placed in the stories[] array of the workHistory entry they belong to (same company/role)
   - If a story cannot be linked to any work history entry, it should still be included but mark it as orphan by including "orphan": true
   - Each story should reference its parent role through context: include company name and position from the parent workHistory entry

2. METRICS (Story & Role Level):
   Story Metrics:
   - Extract ALL numbers: percentages ("+22%", "-3.5%"), counts ("30+"), money ("$2M")
   - Each metric needs: value, context, type (increase/decrease/absolute), parentType ("story")
   - Example: {"value": "+22%", "context": "Week-2 activation", "type": "increase", "parentType": "story"}
   - These metrics belong to specific stories within a role
   
   Role Metrics:
   - A user may often summarize metrics at the role level. If found, use these as role-level metrics.
   - Each metric needs: value, context, type (increase/decrease/absolute), parentType ("role")
   - Example: {"value": "+22%", "context": "Week-2 activation", "type": "increase", "parentType": "role"}
   - These are important top-level metrics that show overall impact in a role
   - CRITICAL: Always include "parentType" field set to "role" for roleMetrics and "story" for story metrics

3. TAGS (Three Levels):
   Company Tags (2-3 tags):
   - Industry/domain: "SaaS", "B2B", "CRM", "PLG", "enterprise"
   - Company stage: "startup", "growth-stage", "established"
   
   Role Tags (3-5 tags):
   - Core competencies demonstrated in this role
   - Options: growth, activation, retention, experimentation, analytics, strategy, 
     execution, plg, process, onboarding, ux, lifecycle, alignment, enablement, adoption
   
   Story Tags (2-3 tags per story):
   - Specific themes of that achievement
   - Use same vocabulary as role tags

4. FIELD NAMES:
   - Use "position" for job title
   - Use "field" for education major
   - Current jobs: endDate = null, current = true

5. DATES AND CURRENT STATUS:
   - Format: "YYYY-MM-DD" (use -01-01 for year-only, -12-31 for end years)
   - If endDate shows "Present", "Current", or no end date, set endDate = null AND current = true
   - Extract the job title from the resume - it is always present and must be extracted

6. ROLE SUMMARY:
   - 1-2 sentences summarizing: area of ownership, why it matters, top result
   - Example: "Owned onboarding, experimentation cadence, and analytics taxonomy to drive activation and conversion. Led 30+ A/B tests yearly."
   - This should be distinct from stories. Purpose is to explain areas of responsibility, scope, team size, etc -- not the specific actions taken or results.

  "company": "FlowHub",
  "position": "Senior Product Manager",  // REQUIRED: Must extract actual title regardless of format

      "tags": ["analytics", "alignment", "lifecycle"],
      "metrics": []
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL REMINDER: Each workHistory entry MUST include populated stories[] arrays. Extract 1-3+ stories per role from the resume text and place them in workHistory[].stories[].

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown, no explanations, no additional text.
