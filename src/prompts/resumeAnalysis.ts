CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:

1. STORIES (Most Important):
   - Stories explain actions, challenges and constraints leading to a result
   - Ideally all stories have an associated metric, but this is not universal
   - If a story has a metric, the metric is associated on the story level
   - Metrics can also be associated on the role level
   - Extract ALL unique stories per role and PLACE THEM IN THE workHistory[].stories[] ARRAY for that specific role
   - Use EXACT text from resume for story.content
   - EVERY work history entry MUST include a stories[] array (even if empty, though you should extract at least 1-3 stories per role)

2. METRICS (Story & Role Level):
   Story Metrics:
   - Extract ALL numbers: percentages ("+22%", "-3.5%"), counts ("30+"), money ("$2M")
   - Each metric needs: value, context, type (increase/decrease/absolute)
   - Example: "+22%" with context "Week-2 activation" and type "increase"
   
   Role Metrics:
   - A user may often summarize metrics at the role level. If found, use these as role-level metrics.
   - These are important top-level metrics that show overall impact in a role

3. TAGS (Three Levels):
   Company Tags (2-3 tags):
   - Industry/domain: "SaaS", "B2B", "CRM", "PLG", "enterprise"
   - Company stage: "startup", "growth-stage", "established"
   
   Role Tags (3-5 tags):
   - Core competencies demonstrated in this role
   - Options: growth, activation, retention, experimentation, analytics, strategy, 
     execution, plg, process, onboarding, ux, lifecycle, alignment, enablement, adoption
   
   Story Tags (2-3 tags per story):
   - Specific themes of that achievement
   - Use same vocabulary as role tags

4. FIELD NAMES:
   - Use "position" not "title" for job title
   - Use "field" not "fieldOfStudy" for education major
   - Current jobs: endDate = null (NOT "Present" string)

5. DATES:
   - Format: "YYYY-MM-DD" (use -01-01 for year-only, -12-31 for end years)
   - Current position: endDate = null

6. ROLE SUMMARY:
   - 1-2 sentences summarizing: area of ownership, why it matters, top result
   - Example: "Owned onboarding, experimentation cadence, and analytics taxonomy to drive activation and conversion. Led 30+ A/B tests yearly."
   - This should be distinct from stories. Purpose is to explain areas of responsibility, scope, team size, etc -- not the specific actions taken or results.

CRITICAL REMINDER: Each workHistory entry MUST include populated stories[] arrays. Extract 1-3+ stories per role from the resume text and place them in workHistory[].stories[].

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown, no explanations, no additional text.
