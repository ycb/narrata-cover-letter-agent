# Handoff Document for Next Chat

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Context:** Model comparison analysis complete, ready to test production flow

---

## 🎯 **Current State**

### ✅ What's Been Completed

1. **Model Comparison Test** (`scripts/model-comparison-test.ts`)
   - Tested gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o across P01-P10
   - Results stored in `test-results/model-comparison-1760845454341.json`
   - Full analysis in `test-results/formal-analysis.md`

2. **Key Findings:**
   - **gpt-4o-mini:** 71% coverage, 10.6s latency, $0.0006 cost
   - **gpt-3.5-turbo:** 62.5% coverage, 6.3s latency, $0.0016 cost
   - **gpt-4o:** 68.5% coverage, 7.7s latency, $0.0167 cost (too expensive)
   
3. **Decision Made:** Use **gpt-4o-mini** for onboarding
   - Best balanced extraction (72% stories, 70% metrics)
   - Especially good on Gold profiles (96% coverage)
   - 10.6s is acceptable with streaming UI

4. **Environment:** `.env` already set to `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` ✅

## 🚀 **Next Steps (Execute in New Chat)**

### **IMMEDIATE: Test P01 with Production Flow**

**Goal:** Confirm 10-13s latency (not 98s) and identify production issue

**Commands:**
```bash
cd "/Users/admin/ narrata"

# Clear existing P01 data
echo "DELETE FROM approved_content WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';
DELETE FROM work_items WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';
DELETE FROM companies WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';
DELETE FROM evaluation_runs WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';
DELETE FROM linkedin_profiles WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';
DELETE FROM sources WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';" | pbcopy

# Run in Supabase SQL Editor ^

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/new-user
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Upload `fixtures/synthetic/v1/raw_uploads/P01_resume.txt`
2. Connect LinkedIn: `https://linkedin.com/in/avery-chen`
3. Upload `fixtures/synthetic/v1/raw_uploads/P01_cover_letter.txt`
4. **Watch browser console for:**
   - `⏱️ Combined LLM analysis took: XXXms` (expect ~13,000ms)
   - `🔄 Auto-healing: Response truncated, retrying...` (expect 0 retries)
   - `📊 Token calculation: ... max tokens` (verify 2500-3000 tokens)

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ **13s total** (not 98s)
- ✅ **0 retries**
- ✅ **7 stories, 16-19 metrics** extracted

**If 98s or retries occur:**
- Production issue confirmed (not model-specific)
- Need to investigate token calculation or network issues

---

### **AFTER Confirmation: Commit Analysis**

```bash
git add test-results/*.md test-results/*.json scripts/model-comparison-test.ts
git commit -m "feat: model comparison analysis - gpt-4o-mini selected

- Tested gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o across P01-P10
- gpt-4o-mini wins: 71% coverage, 10.6s latency, best balanced
- Formal SQS analysis: gpt-4o-mini = 67 SQS (quality/speed)
- Coverage by tier: Gold 96%, Medium 67%, Med-Low 67%
- Production test plan: validate 13s latency (not 98s)

Results:
- test-results/model-comparison-1760845454341.json (raw data)
- test-results/formal-analysis.md (SQS analysis)
- test-results/quality-analysis-vs-ground-truth.md (tier analysis)
- scripts/model-comparison-test.ts (test harness)"

git push origin feature/content-review-and-dashboard-integration
```

### **THEN: Implement Streaming UI**

**Files to modify:**
1. `src/services/fileUploadService.ts` - Already has progress events ✅
2. `src/contexts/UploadProgressContext.tsx` - Already exists ✅
3. `src/components/onboarding/ProgressIndicator.tsx` - Already exists ✅
4. `src/pages/NewUserOnboarding.tsx` - Already integrated ✅

**Test streaming:**
```bash
# Should see real-time progress bar during P01 upload
# Progress should update at: 25% (preparing), 30% (analyzing), 70% (saving), 100% (complete)
```

## 📊 **Key Files & Context**

### **Analysis Files (Read These First)**
- `test-results/formal-analysis.md` - Complete SQS analysis with recommendations
- `test-results/quality-analysis-vs-ground-truth.md` - Coverage by quality tier
- `fixtures/synthetic/v1/expected_counts_v5.json` - Ground truth for validation

### **Source Files**
- `.env` - Model config (already set to gpt-4o-mini)
- `src/services/fileUploadService.ts` - Upload & LLM processing (has progress events)
- `src/services/openaiService.ts` - Token calculation & LLM calls
- `src/prompts/resumeAnalysis.ts` - Extraction prompt
- `src/components/onboarding/ImportSummaryStep.tsx` - Post-import summary

### **Test Data**
- `fixtures/synthetic/v1/raw_uploads/P01_*` - Test files for P01 (Avery Chen)

## 🔍 **Open Questions to Resolve**

### **Production 98s Latency Issue**
- Test shows 13s, production shows 98s
- **Hypothesis:** Retries or blocking calls in production
- **Validation:** Run P01 test and check console logs

### **Missing Stories Issue**
- Test shows 0 stories saved despite extraction working
- **Hypothesis:** `approved_content` insert failing (company_id issue)
- **Validation:** Check Supabase logs during P01 test

## 💬 **How to Ask AI in Next Chat**

**Say this:**

> "Big Daddy here. Continue from HANDOFF_NEXT_CHAT.md. We've completed model comparison analysis (gpt-4o-mini selected). Now execute the production test plan: test P01 import, measure latency, confirm no retries. Expected: 13s total, 7 stories, 0 retries. If confirmed, commit analysis and move to streaming UI implementation."

---

## 📈 **Success Criteria**

1. ✅ P01 import completes in ~13s (not 98s)
2. ✅ 0 LLM retries
3. ✅ 7 stories extracted and saved to database
4. ✅ Import summary shows: 3 companies, 3 roles, 7 stories, LinkedIn connected
5. ✅ Streaming UI shows progress during upload

---

**Good luck, Big Daddy! The analysis is solid, the model is chosen, now we just need to validate production flow and ship streaming UI.** 🚀
