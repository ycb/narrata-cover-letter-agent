Dear Hiring Team,

I'm a product manager focused on PLG growth with eight years in B2B SaaS. At FlowHub I led an onboarding overhaul that increased Week‑2 activation by 22% and lifted trial‑to‑paid by 11% through a steady experiment cadence and in‑app guidance. I paired this with a clear analytics taxonomy so teams could see impact in real time.

Your Senior PM, Growth role maps directly to my strengths: diagnosing friction, sequencing bets, and shipping measurable outcomes. I write clearly, align cross‑functional partners, and keep teams focused on the few metrics that matter. I'd bring a pragmatic plan to instrument funnels, prioritize activation wins, and compound them into expansion.

Best,
Avery
