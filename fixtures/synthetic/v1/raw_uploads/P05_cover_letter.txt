Dear Team,

I work on measurable patient outcomes and clinician efficiency. At Clinio I launched remote‑monitoring flows that improved adherence by 12% and reduced alert fatigue by 18% via smarter thresholds. I'm comfortable with HIPAA constraints and keep an audit‑ready approach to data handling.

I'd prioritize fewer clicks to action, clearer alerts, and steady gains in adherence and outcomes.

Regards,
Samira
