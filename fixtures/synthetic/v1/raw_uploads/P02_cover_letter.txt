Dear Hiring Team,

I focus on energy intelligence that operators adopt. At Sunlytic I launched fleet‑wide health monitoring that reduced critical outages by 14% and introduced SLA‑grade reporting and alert tuning for installers. Earlier I improved quoting workflows that increased win rate by 9% in the SMB installer segment.

I'd bring a practical approach to high‑signal telemetry, actionable alerts, and operator‑friendly UX—to shorten time to value while laying the groundwork for large‑scale optimization.

Sincerely,
Jordan
