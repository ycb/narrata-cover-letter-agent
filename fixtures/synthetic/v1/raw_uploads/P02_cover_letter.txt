Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Growth Product Manager role at your company. As a growth-focused product manager with 7+ years of experience, I have consistently delivered measurable results in user acquisition, retention, and engagement.

At GrowthCo, I launched a viral referral program that increased user acquisition by 45% while reducing customer acquisition cost by 30%. This program became our primary growth engine and was featured in industry publications as a best practice case study. I also built comprehensive onboarding funnel optimization that improved Day-7 retention by 18% and reduced time-to-value by 40%.

My approach to growth is data-driven and user-centric. I implemented a sophisticated push notification strategy that increased engagement by 25% and session frequency by 15%, while maintaining high user satisfaction scores. This demonstrates my ability to balance growth metrics with user experience.

Previously at MobileFirst, I owned the user onboarding flow and increased activation rates by 35% while reducing drop-off by 20%. I also launched gamification features that drove DAU up by 22% and increased user lifetime value by 28%, showing my ability to create engaging experiences that drive business results.

I am particularly excited about your company's mission and believe my experience in growth marketing, user acquisition, and mobile-first product development would be valuable in scaling your product. I would love to discuss how my background can contribute to your growth objectives.

Best regards,
Jordan Alvarez
