Dear Hiring Team,

I scale teams and outcomes. At AtlasSuite I grew the PM org from 3 to 7, established an operating cadence, and expanded ARR by 24% through pricing/packaging and two product launches. I keep a tight link between strategy, portfolio choices, and weekly delivery.

I'd bring a pragmatic approach to sequencing bets, coaching PMs, and aligning GTM with product to deliver durable growth.

Regards,
Sophia
