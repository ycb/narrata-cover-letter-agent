Dear Hiring Committee,

I build fast paths to yes in checkout. At PayWave I grew conversion by 15% with a steady test cadence and simplified forms, and partnered with Risk to reduce false positives by 8%. Earlier at NeoBanker I improved KYC time‑to‑verify by 28% through API consolidation and clearer states.

Your PM, Checkout Growth role aligns with my strengths in experiment design, instrumentation, and cross‑team execution. I'd focus on shaving milliseconds, clarifying friction points, and sequencing bets to compound impact.

Regards,
Riley
