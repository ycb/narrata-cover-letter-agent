Dear Hiring Manager,

I deliver platform changes that reduce risk and speed delivery. At StratusWorks I led a monolith‑to‑services program that cut incidents by 27% and introduced feature flags and kill‑switches to de‑risk launches. Earlier I shipped SDKs and tooling that improved developer satisfaction by 30%.

I translate reliability into business outcomes by pairing SLAs with product velocity and customer impact.

Sincerely,
Diego
