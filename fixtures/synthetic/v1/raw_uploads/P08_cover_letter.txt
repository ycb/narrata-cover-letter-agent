Dear Hiring Team,

I'm transitioning from QA/operations into product management. At TestCraft I created a regression suite that reduced release defects by ~20% and set up triage rituals that improved accountability. In operations I built onboarding playbooks and vendor SLAs.

I bring disciplined executionâ€”tight specs, crisp acceptance criteria, and curiosity to learn quickly as an APM.

Best,
Priya
