Hello,

I optimize marketplace systems for measurable outcomes. At VendorLoop I improved match rate by 13% with ranking and constraint tuning and increased ARPU by 6% through pricing/packaging experiments. Earlier I launched SLA benchmarking that reduced late deliveries by 9%.

I'd focus on search quality, supply health, and pricing levers to compound GMV.

Thanks,
Noah
