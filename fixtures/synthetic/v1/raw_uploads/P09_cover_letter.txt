Hi Team,

I pair UX rigor with measurable outcomes. At MobileCare I redesigned support flows that lifted our app rating by 1.1 points and prototyped a chatbot that reduced time‑to‑resolution by 17%. I'd focus on proactive diagnostics and clear content to lower effort while improving trust.

Thanks,
Leo
