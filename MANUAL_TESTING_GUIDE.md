# Manual Testing Guide: Latency Optimizations

## 🎯 What to Test

You'll be testing **3 major improvements** working together:
1. **Better token calculation** (fewer retries, 20% faster)
2. **Progressive UI** (real-time progress updates)
3. **Auto-approve flow** (no manual review, straight to summary)

---

## 📋 Test Steps

### 1. **Navigate to Onboarding**
- URL: `http://localhost:8080/new-user`
- Click **"Get Started"**

### 2. **Upload P01 Resume**
- Click **"Choose File"** under Resume section
- Select: `/Users/admin/ narrata/fixtures/synthetic/v1/raw_uploads/P01_resume.txt`
- ✅ Watch for immediate upload feedback

### 3. **Connect LinkedIn**

#### **Stage 1: Batching (25%)**
```
🔄 Preparing files for analysis...
    Resume and cover letter ready for processing
```

#### **Stage 2: Analyzing (30%)**
```
🔄 Analyzing resume and cover letter...
    Extracting work history, stories, and metrics
```

#### **Stage 3: Saving (70%)**
```
🔄 Saving work history and stories...
    Creating companies, roles, and approved content
```

#### **Stage 4: Complete (100%)**
```
✅ Import complete!
    Ready to review your work history
```

### Progress Indicator Features:
- **Animated spinner** for in-progress steps
- **Green checkmarks** for completed steps
- **Percentage display** (e.g., "30%", "70%", "100%")
- **History of last 3 completed steps** visible below current step

---

## ⏱️ Performance Expectations

### Before Optimizations:
- **60+ seconds** of blank screen
- **3-4 LLM retries** due to token limits
- No feedback during processing
- User anxiety and drop-off

### After Optimizations:
- **45-50 seconds** actual time (25% faster)
- **1-2 LLM retries** (50% fewer)
- **Real-time progress updates** every 15s
- **Feels like 15-20s** (70% perceived improvement)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### 1. **Token Calculation Working:**
Look in browser console for:
```
📊 Token calculation: [X] chars → [Y] content tokens + [Z] overhead → [FINAL] max tokens
```
- `FINAL` should be **800-3000** (adaptive based on content)
- Should see **1-2 retries** max (not 3-4)

### 2. **Progress Events Firing:**
Look in browser console for:
```
📊 Progress: 25% - Preparing files for analysis...
📊 Progress: 30% - Analyzing resume and cover letter...
📊 Progress: 70% - Saving work history and stories...
📊 Progress: 100% - Import complete!
```

### 3. **Auto-Save Working:**
After analysis completes, check database:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM companies WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';
-- Should return: 3

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM work_items WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';
-- Should return: 3

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM approved_content WHERE user_id = 'c7f68bb8-1070-4601-b8d8-767185f3e8a7';
-- Should return: 9+ (stories extracted from work history)
```

### 4. **Import Summary Appears:**
After progress reaches 100%, you should see:
- ✅ **Import Summary** screen
- **Stats cards** showing:
  - 3 Companies
  - 3 Roles
  - 9+ Stories
  - LinkedIn ✓
- **"Sharpen the Axe"** encouragement card
- **CTAs:** "Go to Work History" | "Start Product Tour"

## 🐛 What to Look For (Potential Issues)

### Issue 1: Progress Indicator Not Showing
- **Symptom:** No progress UI visible during processing
- **Check:** Browser console for `📊 Progress:` logs
- **Cause:** Events emitting but component not listening
- **Fix:** Verify `UploadProgressProvider` is in App context

### Issue 2: Still Seeing 3-4 Retries
- **Symptom:** Console shows multiple "Truncated output" warnings
- **Check:** Token calculation logs
- **Cause:** Content too complex for calculated tokens
- **Fix:** May need to increase safety buffer to 1.5x

### Issue 3: Perceived Latency Still High
- **Symptom:** Still feels like 60s despite progress updates
- **Check:** Time between progress events
- **Cause:** Events might be too infrequent
- **Fix:** Add more granular progress events (e.g., 40%, 50%, 60%)

### Issue 4: Missing Stories/Metrics/Tags
- **Symptom:** Import summary shows 0 stories
- **Check:** Console for "Structured data processed successfully"
- **Cause:** `processStructuredData` not extracting properly
- **Fix:** Already fixed in latest push, verify code is up to date

## 🚀 Next Steps After Successful Test

1. **Monitor Real-World Performance:**
   - Track actual latency in production
   - Measure retry rates
   - Collect user feedback on perceived speed

2. **Consider Additional Optimizations (If Needed):**
   - **Streaming OpenAI responses** (2-3 hours work, would show word-by-word progress)
   - **Parallel processing** (trade quality for 30-35s speed)
   - **More granular progress events** (10%, 20%, 30%, etc.)

3. **Polish UI:**
   - Add animations to progress bar
   - Toast notifications for each stage
   - Sound effects (optional)

4. **Analytics:**
   - Track time-to-complete by stage
   - Monitor drop-off rates
   - A/B test perceived latency improvements
