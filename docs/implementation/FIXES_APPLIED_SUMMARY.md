# Fixes Applied - Synthetic Mode & Data Processing

## Summary
Fixed three critical issues in the upload processing pipeline:
1. **Cover letter workHistory not processed** - Now processes workHistory from cover letters
2. **LinkedIn data fetching missing** - Added Appify API integration (replaces PDL)
3. **Unified profile creation missing** - Added automatic unified profile creation from all sources

## Changes Made

### 1. Process Structured Data for ALL Uploads ✅

**File:** `src/services/fileUploadService.ts`

**Change:** Extended `processStructuredData()` to be called for both resume AND cover letter files if they contain workHistory.

```typescript
// Before: Only resume
if (type === 'resume') {
  await this.processStructuredData(structuredData, sourceId, accessToken);
}

// After: Resume + Cover Letter (if has workHistory)
if (type === 'resume' || (type === 'coverLetter' && structuredData.workHistory && Array.isArray(structuredData.workHistory) && structuredData.workHistory.length > 0)) {
  await this.processStructuredData(structuredData, sourceId, accessToken);
}
```

**Also Updated:** Combined analysis flow now processes cover letter workHistory:
- Line 1340: Added check for cover letter workHistory and calls `processStructuredData()`

### 2. Added Appify Service for LinkedIn Scraping ✅

**New File:** `src/services/appifyService.ts`

**Purpose:** Replace People Data Labs (PDL) with Appify API for better quality LinkedIn data.

**Key Methods:**
- `enrichPerson(params)` - Direct API enrichment
- `enrichFromResumeData(name, resumeData, linkedinUrl)` - Smart enrichment using available data
- `convertToStructuredData(appifyData)` - Convert Appify format to app format
- `isConfigured()` - Check if API key is available

**Configuration:**
- Requires `VITE_APPIFY_API_KEY` environment variable
- API endpoint: `https://api.cloud.appifyhub.com/v1/scrape/linkedin` (TODO: verify exact endpoint)

### 3. Added LinkedIn Data Fetching & Unified Profile Creation ✅

**File:** `src/services/fileUploadService.ts`

**New Methods:**
- `fetchAndProcessLinkedInData(accessToken)` - Fetches LinkedIn via Appify, saves as source, processes workHistory
- `createUnifiedProfile(accessToken)` - Creates unified profile from resume + cover letter + LinkedIn

**Flow After Combined Analysis:**
1. Resume processed → `work_items` created with `source_id`
2. Cover letter processed → `work_items` created if has workHistory
3. **LinkedIn data fetched via Appify** → saved as source → `work_items` created
4. **Unified profile created** from all three sources

## Root Cause of Synthetic Mode Issue

**Problem:** Work History page showed "Preview Mode" because no `work_items` were being created during upload.

**Why:**
- `processStructuredData()` only called for resumes
- Cover letters weren't processed (even if they had workHistory)
- LinkedIn data wasn't being fetched at all
- Existing uploads created `sources.structured_data` but never populated `work_items` table

**Fix:**
- Now processes ALL sources that have workHistory
- LinkedIn data automatically fetched and processed
- All `work_items` properly linked via `source_id`

## Next Steps

### 1. ✅ Appify Data Structure Updated
- Updated `AppifyPersonData` interface to match actual API response structure
- Includes `basic_info` with nested `location` object
- Experience entries use `start_date: { year, month }` format
- Education entries follow same date format
- Added support for `projects`, `certifications`, and `languages`

### 2. ✅ Appify Template Created
- Created `fixtures/synthetic/v1/appify_template.json` from provided RTF file
- Template shows actual Appify response structure
- Can be used to generate synthetic LinkedIn data for P01-P10

### 3. ⏳ Generate Synthetic LinkedIn Data (TODO)
- Use `appify_template.json` as base
- Generate LinkedIn data for each synthetic user (P01-P10)
- Modify names, companies, dates to match each persona
- Save as fixture files for testing

### 4. Add Environment Variable (When Ready for API)
- Add `VITE_APPIFY_API_KEY` to `.env` file when ready to make live API calls
- Update `docs/setup/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`
- Note: Currently using synthetic data, so API key not required yet

### 5. Re-process Existing Data
- Existing P01-P10 sources have `structured_data` but no `work_items`
- Need to re-run `processStructuredData()` for existing sources
- Or create migration script to backfill `work_items` from `sources.structured_data`

### 6. Test Full Flow
- Upload resume + cover letter → verify both processed
- Load synthetic LinkedIn data → verify conversion works correctly
- Verify unified profile created from all three sources
- Verify Work History page shows real data (not preview mode)

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `src/services/fileUploadService.ts`
   - Added Appify service import
   - Updated `processStructuredData()` call condition
   - Added cover letter workHistory processing in combined flow
   - Added `fetchAndProcessLinkedInData()` method
   - Added `createUnifiedProfile()` method

2. ✅ `src/services/appifyService.ts` (NEW)
   - Complete Appify API service implementation
   - Replaces PDL functionality
   - Converts Appify data to structured format

## Implementation Plan Updates Needed

The synthetic mode implementation plan should be updated to reflect:
- ✅ Process structured data for resume AND cover letter
- ✅ Use Appify API (not PDL) for LinkedIn scraping
- ✅ Automatic unified profile creation after all sources processed
- ⏳ Need to verify Appify API endpoint and format
- ⏳ Need to re-process existing data to populate work_items
